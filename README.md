# Client-Server-API-Go

### This repository is a Server-Client API developed in Golang as a partial assessment for the completion of the Postgraduate Degree in Golang

### In this work, concepts such as the use of contexts, HTTP requests and insertion of records into an SQLite database.

The purpose of this project is the creation of two systems: client and server.

The requirements are:
1. The client must make an HTTP request to server.go requesting the dollar quote.

2. The server must consume the API containing the Dollar and Real exchange rate at the address: https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/last/USD-BRL and then return the result to the client in JSON format .

3. Using the "context" package, server.go must register each quote received in the SQLite database, with the maximum timeout to call the dollar quote API being 200ms and the maximum timeout to be able to persist the data on the bank it should be 10ms.

4. The client will only need to receive the current exchange rate from server.go ("bid" field in the JSON). Using the "context" package, client.go will have a maximum timeout of 300ms to receive the result from server.go.

5. The 3 contexts should return an error in the logs if the execution time is insufficient.

6. The client will have to save the current quote in a file "cotacao.txt" in the format: Dollar: {value}

7. The necessary endpoint generated by server.go for this challenge will be: /cotacao and the port to be used by the HTTP server will be 8080.
